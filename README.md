# TextEditor
## Introduction
I’ve always enjoyed building beautiful Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) to the back-end computations, number-crunching and algorithms of my programs.
This project will be about how to build a simple but useful rich-text editor using Qt Disigner . The first part of the tutorial will focus on the core features and skeleton of the editor. In part two, we’ll take care of text-formatting

 This is what it’ll look like at the end of this project
