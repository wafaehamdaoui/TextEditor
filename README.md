# TextEditor
## Introduction
I’ve always enjoyed building beautiful Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) to the back-end computations, number-crunching and algorithms of my programs.
This project will be about how to build a simple but useful rich-text editor using Qt Disigner . The first part of the tutorial will focus on the core features and skeleton of the editor. In part two, we’ll take care of text-formatting

 This is what it’ll look like at the end of this project

 Before we get started,  we need to add resources files for icons.
 
 ## Resource Files
The text editor uses several icons to represent various actions. The icons are in the resources directory which is directly under the TextEditor project directory. The images as well as the project files are also listed in the icons documentation .

To register the image files, in the Edit mode, right-click the icons.qrc file and select Open in Editor.

Click the Add button and select Add Files.

In the file manager, select the files to be added.

## Part 1:

We will mainly use the designer for a rapid design of  text editor features.

Set of menus for our application.
